# AnEx Presentation: Getting Started with Python and Useful Public APIs
Materials for the 2025 AnEx session on using the Open Data API.

Welcome to this session on getting started with Python and the Open Data API!

To get started, you'll need the following things:

* Use this guide to generate an [App Token for Open Data](https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/articles/210138558-Generating-App-Tokens-and-API-Keys)
* Create a .env file to save your app token as an environment variable (more details on that in the presentation).
* Open the Colab notebook if you want to run the script alongside me!
